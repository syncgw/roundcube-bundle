**sync•gw** is the one and only fully portable server software available providing synchronization service between nearly any mobile device and your web server.

## RoundCube bundle for sync•gw ##
**sync•gw** requires an interface bundle to store and handle data during synchronization. 
This data base handler includes the MySQL data base handler mentioned above. Additionally this interface handler synchronizes data (e.g. **contact** records) from RoundCube with **sync•gw** internal records. Your application users can always access most current data.

## Installation ##
To install the **sync•gw RoundCube bundle** please go to your web server base directory and enter

```bash
composer require syncgw/roundcube-bundle
```
